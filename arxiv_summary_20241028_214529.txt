标题：FISHNET: Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning, Expert Swarms, and Task Planning
作者：Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar, Lucas Cecchi, William Watson
原文摘要：
Financial intelligence generation from vast data sources has typically relied
on traditional methods of knowledge-graph construction or database engineering.
Recently, fine-tuned financial domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs),
have emerged. While these advancements are promising, limitations such as high
inference costs, hallucinations, and the complexity of concurrently analyzing
high-dimensional financial data, emerge. This motivates our invention FISHNET
(Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning,
Expert swarming, and Task planning), an agentic architecture that accomplishes
highly complex analytical tasks for more than 98,000 regulatory filings that
vary immensely in terms of semantics, data hierarchy, or format. FISHNET shows
remarkable performance for financial insight generation (61.8% success rate
over 5.0% Routing, 45.6% RAG R-Precision). We conduct rigorous ablations to
empirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the
optimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be
leveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and
data integrity that are critical for financial tasks.

标题：DA-VIL: Adaptive Dual-Arm Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning and Variable Impedance Control
作者：Md Faizal Karim, Shreya Bollimuntha, Mohammed Saad Hashmi, Autrio Das, Gaurav Singh, Srinath Sridhar, Arun Kumar Singh, Nagamanikandan Govindan, K Madhava Krishna
原文摘要：
Dual-arm manipulation is an area of growing interest in the robotics
community. Enabling robots to perform tasks that require the coordinated use of
two arms, is essential for complex manipulation tasks such as handling large
objects, assembling components, and performing human-like interactions.
However, achieving effective dual-arm manipulation is challenging due to the
need for precise coordination, dynamic adaptability, and the ability to manage
interaction forces between the arms and the objects being manipulated. We
propose a novel pipeline that combines the advantages of policy learning based
on environment feedback and gradient-based optimization to learn controller
gains required for the control outputs. This allows the robotic system to
dynamically modulate its impedance in response to task demands, ensuring
stability and dexterity in dual-arm operations. We evaluate our pipeline on a
trajectory-tracking task involving a variety of large, complex objects with
different masses and geometries. The performance is then compared to three
other established methods for controlling dual-arm robots, demonstrating
superior results.

标题：Integrating LoRaWAN with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks for Enhanced Campus Communication
作者：Ramakant Kumar
原文摘要：
The integration of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) with Mobile Ad-hoc
Networks (MANETs) presents a promising solution for enhancing communication
networks within campus environments. This paper explores the unique advantages
of combining these two technologies, including scalability, energy efficiency,
flexibility, and support for diverse applications. LoRaWAN low power
consumption and extended range capabilities address the challenges of
traditional communication methods, enabling reliable data transmission across
various campus scenarios, such as emergency alerts, event coordination, and
real-time monitoring. We also identify key challenges faced in this integrated
architecture, including signal interference, data packet collisions, and energy
management. By providing a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and
solutions categorized by the network protocol stack layers, this study aims to
inform future research and development efforts in creating robust, energy
efficient communication systems tailored for modern educational institutions.
Ultimately, the findings highlight the potential of LoRaWAN MANET architectures
to transform campus communication into a more reliable, adaptable, and cost
effective framework.

标题：IPPON: Common Sense Guided Informative Path Planning for Object Goal Navigation
作者：Kaixian Qu, Jie Tan, Tingnan Zhang, Fei Xia, Cesar Cadena, Marco Hutter
原文摘要：
Navigating efficiently to an object in an unexplored environment is a
critical skill for general-purpose intelligent robots. Recent approaches to
this object goal navigation problem have embraced a modular strategy,
integrating classical exploration algorithms-notably frontier exploration-with
a learned semantic mapping/exploration module. This paper introduces a novel
informative path planning and 3D object probability mapping approach. The
mapping module computes the probability of the object of interest through
semantic segmentation and a Bayes filter. Additionally, it stores probabilities
for common objects, which semantically guides the exploration based on common
sense priors from a large language model. The planner terminates when the
current viewpoint captures enough voxels identified with high confidence as the
object of interest. Although our planner follows a zero-shot approach, it
achieves state-of-the-art performance as measured by the Success weighted by
Path Length (SPL) and Soft SPL in the Habitat ObjectNav Challenge 2023,
outperforming other works by more than 20%. Furthermore, we validate its
effectiveness on real robots. Project webpage: https://ippon-paper.github.io/

标题：Age of Coded Updates In Gossip Networks Under Memory and Memoryless Schemes
作者：Erkan Bayram, Melih Bastopcu, Mohamed-Ali Belabbas, Tamer Başar
原文摘要：
We consider an information update system on a gossip network, where a source
node encodes information into $n$ total keys such that any subset of at least
$k+1$ keys can fully reconstruct the original information. This encoding
process follows the principles of a $k$-out-of-$n$ threshold system. The
encoded updates are then disseminated across the network through peer-to-peer
communication. We have two different types of nodes in a network: subscriber
nodes, which receive a unique key from the source node for every status update
instantaneously, and nonsubscriber nodes, which receive a unique key for an
update only if the node is selected by the source, and this selection is
renewed for each update. For the message structure between nodes, we consider
two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's
current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the
nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the
timeliness of information updates by using a recent performance metric, the
version age of information. We present explicit formulas for the time average
AoI in a scalable homogeneous network as functions of the network parameters
under a memoryless scheme. Additionally, we provide strict lower and upper
bounds for the time average AoI under a memory scheme.

标题：ProvocationProbe: Instigating Hate Speech Dataset from Twitter
作者：Abhay Kumar, Vigneshwaran Shankaran, Rajesh Sharma
原文摘要：
In the recent years online social media platforms has been flooded with
hateful remarks such as racism, sexism, homophobia etc. As a result, there have
been many measures taken by various social media platforms to mitigate the
spread of hate-speech over the internet. One particular concept within the
domain of hate speech is instigating hate, which involves provoking hatred
against a particular community, race, colour, gender, religion or ethnicity. In
this work, we introduce \textit{ProvocationProbe} - a dataset designed to
explore what distinguishes instigating hate speech from general hate speech.
For this study, we collected around twenty thousand tweets from Twitter,
encompassing a total of nine global controversies. These controversies span
various themes including racism, politics, and religion. In this paper, i) we
present an annotated dataset after comprehensive examination of all the
controversies, ii) we also highlight the difference between hate speech and
instigating hate speech by identifying distinguishing features, such as
targeted identity attacks and reasons for hate.

标题：The Sound of Silence in Social Networks
作者：Jesús Aranda, Juan Francisco Díaz, David Gaona, Frank Valencia
原文摘要：
We generalize the classic multi-agent DeGroot model for opinion dynamics to
incorporate the Spiral of Silence theory from political science. This theory
states that individuals may withhold their opinions when they perceive them to
be in the minority. As in the DeGroot model, a community of agents is
represented as a weighted directed graph whose edges indicate how much agents
influence one another. However, agents whose current opinions are in the
minority become silent (i.e., they do not express their opinion). Two models
for opinion update are then introduced. In the memoryless opinion model
($\mbox{SOM}^-$), agents update their opinion by taking the weighted average of
their non-silent neighbors' opinions. In the memory based opinion model
($\mbox{SOM}^+$), agents update their opinions by taking the weighted average
of the opinions of all their neighbors, but for silent neighbors, their most
recent opinion is considered.
  We show that for $\mbox{SOM}^-$ convergence to consensus is guaranteed for
clique graphs but, unlike for the classic DeGroot, not guaranteed for
strongly-connected aperiodic graphs. In contrast, we show that for
$\mbox{SOM}^+$ convergence to consensus is not guaranteed even for clique
graphs. We showcase our models through simulations offering experimental
insights that align with key aspects of the Spiral of Silence theory. These
findings reveal the impact of silence dynamics on opinion formation and
highlight the limitations of consensus in more nuanced social models.

AI总结：
本文将经典的多智能体DeGroot模型扩展，纳入了政治科学中的“沉默的螺旋”理论。该理论认为，当个体感知到自己的意见属于少数派时，可能会选择不表达自己的意见。在DeGroot模型中，智能体社区被表示为一个加权有向图，图的边表示智能体之间的相互影响。但是，持有少数派意见的智能体会选择沉默（即不表达自己的意见）。文章介绍了两种意见更新模型：无记忆意见模型（SOM^-）和基于记忆的意见模型（SOM^+）。在无记忆意见模型中，智能体会通过取非沉默邻居意见的加权平均值来更新自己的意见。在基于记忆的意见模型中，智能体会通过取所有邻居意见的加权平均值来更新自己的意见，但对于沉默的邻居，会考虑他们最近的意见。

研究结果表明，对于无记忆意见模型（SOM^-），在团（clique）图上可以保证达到共识，但在强连通非周期图上，与经典DeGroot模型不同，不能保证达到共识。相比之下，对于基于记忆的意见模型（SOM^+），即使在团图上也不能保证达到共识。通过模拟实验，文章展示了这些模型，并提供了与“沉默的螺旋”理论关键方面一致的实验见解。这些发现揭示了沉默动态对意见形成的影响，并强调了在更复杂的社会模型中达成共识的局限性。

标题：Community detection on directed networks with missing edges
作者：Nicola Pedreschi, Renaud Lambiotte, Alexandre Bovet
原文摘要：
Identifying significant community structures in networks with incomplete data
is a challenging task, as the reliability of solutions diminishes with
increasing levels of missing information. However, in many empirical contexts,
some information about the uncertainty in the network measurements can be
estimated. In this work, we extend the recently developed Flow Stability
framework, originally designed for detecting communities in time-varying
networks, to address the problem of community detection in weighted, directed
networks with missing links. Our approach leverages known uncertainty levels in
nodes' out-degrees to enhance the robustness of community detection. Through
comparisons on synthetic networks and a real-world network of messaging
channels on the Telegram platform, we demonstrate that our method delivers more
reliable community structures, even when a significant portion of data is
missing.

AI总结：
这篇论文的主要研究内容是关于在网络数据不完整的情况下识别网络中的重要社区结构。研究的挑战在于，随着缺失信息的增加，解决方案的可靠性会降低。然而，在许多实际情境中，可以估计网络测量中的不确定性。作者扩展了最近开发的Flow Stability框架，该框架最初是为了检测时变网络中的社区而设计的，现在被用来解决在有缺失链接的加权、有向网络中的社区检测问题。这种方法利用了节点出度的已知不确定性水平来增强社区检测的鲁棒性。通过在合成网络和Telegram平台上的消息通道真实网络的比较，作者展示了他们的方法即使在大量数据缺失的情况下也能提供更可靠的社区结构。

标题：Frozen-DETR: Enhancing DETR with Image Understanding from Frozen Foundation Models
作者：Shenghao Fu, Junkai Yan, Qize Yang, Xihan Wei, Xiaohua Xie, Wei-Shi Zheng
原文摘要：
Recent vision foundation models can extract universal representations and
show impressive abilities in various tasks. However, their application on
object detection is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In
this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature
enhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection.
Specifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image
understanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways.
First, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding
of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the
detector's decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch
tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector's encoder
by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as
plug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly
enhance the detector's performance while preventing the problems caused by the
architecture discrepancy between the detector's backbone and the foundation
model. With such a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO
from 49.0% AP to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP) by
integrating one or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation
set after training for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector's backbone.
